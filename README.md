# codecademyLearnPython3Projects
This repository will be responsible for storing all the projects I have completed throughout the Learn Python 3 course on codecademy starting from the strings module. This will be able to demonstrate further skills from the codecademyPythonCodeChallenges repository with larger, more in depth projects that remain at a beginner level.
